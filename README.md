## Features

- **Complete CPU family support**: M68000 through M68060, including EC/LC variants and the SCC68070
- **Two explicit execution contracts**: transaction-accurate cycle scheduling for hardware emulators, and an instruction-budgeted fast path for HLE
- **Bus-visible accuracy**: 68000/68010 two-word prefetch, model-specific access ordering, and internal clock synchronization through `AddressBus::sync`
- **Memory-safe core**: The interpreter — instruction semantics, decode, exceptions, MMU, FPU — is 100% safe Rust. The optional fast paths (fastmem batch execution and the trace JIT) use a small, contract-documented `unsafe` perimeter, fenced by step-vs-batch equivalence tests
- **FPU emulation**: Software 80-bit extended precision, packed decimal, and model-specific 68881/68882/68040/68060 behavior
- **MMU emulation**: 68030/68040/68060 translation, ATCs, transparent translation, `PTEST`, fault frames, and writeback
- **HLE-ready**: Built-in trap interception for High-Level Emulation
- **`no_std` capable**: Disable the default `std` feature to embed the emulator in bare-metal hosts
- **Save-state ready**: Optional `serde` support serializes architectural state while rebuilding runtime caches on load
- **Extensively tested**: Validated against multiple industry-standard test suites

## Quick Start

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
m68k = "0.7"
```

The default build has no JIT compiler dependency. Native applications that use
`run_batch()` can enable Cranelift compilation explicitly:

```toml
[dependencies]
m68k = { version = "0.7", features = ["jit"] }
```

### `no_std`

Disabling the default `std` feature builds the crate against `core` + `alloc`:

```toml
[dependencies]
m68k = { version = "0.7", default-features = false }
```

The downstream binary must supply a `#[global_allocator]`. In practice it is
never called on the interpreter paths: `step()` and `run_for_cycles()` perform
**zero** heap allocations, which `tests/alloc_probe.rs` asserts. Only
`run_batch()` allocates, building a 1 MiB decode table and multi-megabyte trace
caches on first use — so memory-constrained hosts should stay on the
interpreter paths, or shrink `TRACE_CACHE_SIZE`.

`no_std` builds assume a single-threaded emulator: the lazily built timing
tables and the trace cache use single-threaded interior mutability in place of
`OnceLock` and `thread_local!`. Driving two `CpuCore`s from different cores in
a `no_std` build is not supported.

### Basic Usage

```rust
use m68k::{CpuCore, CpuType, AddressBus, StepResult};

// Implement your memory bus
struct MyBus { memory: Vec<u8> }

impl AddressBus for MyBus {
    fn read_byte(&mut self, addr: u32) -> u8 {
        self.memory.get(addr as usize).copied().unwrap_or(0)
    }
    fn write_byte(&mut self, addr: u32, val: u8) {
        if let Some(m) = self.memory.get_mut(addr as usize) { *m = val; }
    }
    fn read_word(&mut self, addr: u32) -> u16 {
        u16::from_be_bytes([self.read_byte(addr), self.read_byte(addr + 1)])
    }
    fn write_word(&mut self, addr: u32, val: u16) {
        let bytes = val.to_be_bytes();
        self.write_byte(addr, bytes[0]);
        self.write_byte(addr + 1, bytes[1]);
    }
    fn read_long(&mut self, addr: u32) -> u32 {
        ((self.read_word(addr) as u32) << 16) | self.read_word(addr + 2) as u32
    }
    fn write_long(&mut self, addr: u32, val: u32) {
        self.write_word(addr, (val >> 16) as u16);
        self.write_word(addr + 2, val as u16);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut cpu = CpuCore::new();
    cpu.set_cpu_type(CpuType::M68000);

    let mut bus = MyBus { memory: vec![0; 0x10000] };

    // Set up vectors: SSP at 0x1000, PC at 0x400
    bus.write_long(0, 0x1000);
    bus.write_long(4, 0x400);

    // Write a NOP instruction at 0x400
    bus.write_word(0x400, 0x4E71);

    cpu.reset(&mut bus);

    loop {
        match cpu.step(&mut bus) {
            StepResult::Ok { cycles } => println!("Executed: {} cycles", cycles),
            StepResult::Stopped => break,
            StepResult::AlineTrap { opcode } => println!("A-line trap: {:04X}", opcode),
            StepResult::FlineTrap { opcode } => println!("F-line trap: {:04X}", opcode),
            StepResult::TrapInstruction { trap_num } => println!("TRAP #{}", trap_num),
            StepResult::Breakpoint { bp_num } => println!("BKPT #{}", bp_num),
            StepResult::IllegalInstruction { opcode } => println!("Illegal instruction: {:04X}", opcode),
        }
    }
}
```

### High-Level Emulation (HLE)

Intercept traps for OS emulation or debugger integration with CPU/bus access:

```rust
use m68k::{AddressBus, CpuCore, HleHandler};

struct MacToolbox;

// All methods in HleHandler are optional (default return is false).
// Return `true` to indicate the HLE handled the trap (suppressing the hardware exception).
// Return `false` to let the CPU take the standard hardware exception.
impl HleHandler for MacToolbox {
    // Optional: Intercept A-line traps (0xAxxx)
    fn handle_aline(
        &mut self,
        cpu: &mut CpuCore,
        bus: &mut dyn AddressBus,
        opcode: u16,
    ) -> bool {
        println!("A-line trap: {:04X} at PC=0x{:08X}", opcode, cpu.pc);
        // ... implement HLE logic ...
        true // Handled: do NOT take the standard Line-A exception
    }

    // Optional: Intercept TRAP #n instructions
    fn handle_trap(&mut self, _cpu: &mut CpuCore, _bus: &mut dyn AddressBus, trap: u8) -> bool {
        // Example: Only intercept TRAP #0, let #1-15 go to real hardware vectors
        if trap == 0 {
            println!("OS Call (TRAP #0)");
            true // Handled
        } else {
            false // Not handled: CPU will take exception vector 32+n
        }
    }

    // Optional: Intercept F-line traps (coprocessor instructions)
    fn handle_fline(&mut self, _cpu: &mut CpuCore, _bus: &mut dyn AddressBus, opcode: u16) -> bool {
        println!("Generic Coprocessor instruction: {:04X}", opcode);
        true // Handled
    }

    // Optional: Intercept BKPT #n instructions
    fn handle_breakpoint(&mut self, _cpu: &mut CpuCore, _bus: &mut dyn AddressBus, bp: u8) -> bool {
        println!("Breakpoint #{}", bp);
        true // Handled
    }

    // Optional: Intercept ILLEGAL instructions (0x4AFC)
    fn handle_illegal(&mut self, _cpu: &mut CpuCore, _bus: &mut dyn AddressBus, opcode: u16) -> bool {
        println!("Illegal instruction: {:04X}", opcode);
        false // Not handled: CPU will take illegal instruction exception
    }
}

fn emulate(cpu: &mut CpuCore, bus: &mut impl AddressBus) {
    let mut hle = MacToolbox;
    let result = cpu.step_with_hle_handler(bus, &mut hle);
}
```

### Choosing an Approach

| Method | Budget | Execution contract | Host-visible exit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`step()`** | One instruction | Transaction-accurate `AddressBus` accesses and cycles | Surfaces A-line, F-line, `TRAP`, `BKPT`, and illegal instructions without taking their exception |
| **`step_with_hle_handler()`** | One instruction | Same precise path as `step()` | Offers traps to `HleHandler`; unhandled traps take the hardware exception |
| **`execute()`** | CPU cycles | Precise path; whole instructions may overshoot the requested cycles | Takes traps as hardware exceptions and returns consumed cycles |
| **`run_for_cycles()`** | CPU cycles | Precise path with actual cycle and instruction totals | Surfaces traps, STOP, and bus-requested instruction boundaries separately |
| **`run_for_cycles_with_hook()`** | CPU cycles | Same precise path, with host synchronization after each normally completed instruction | The hook can continue or request an instruction-boundary return |
| **`run_for_cycles_with_boundary_hook()`** | CPU cycles | Same precise path, with separate instruction and interrupt-entry events | The hook can synchronize or return before the first handler instruction |
| **`run_batch()`** | Instructions | Throughput path using decoded-op caching, optional direct RAM, and portable or `jit`-enabled native hot-loop traces | Surfaces traps, STOP, watched PCs, or budget exhaustion |

Use **`step()`** for debugger-style control. Use **`run_for_cycles()`** when a
machine scheduler needs to advance the CPU by a clock budget without losing
bus ordering or trap state:

```rust
use m68k::CycleBatchExit;

let result = cpu.run_for_cycles(&mut bus, 512);
match result.exit {
    CycleBatchExit::BudgetExhausted => {
        // result.cycles may be greater than 512: instructions are never split.
    }
    CycleBatchExit::Stopped => {
        // Wait for a serviceable interrupt.
    }
    CycleBatchExit::BoundaryRequested => {
        // Apply work queued by the bus before resuming the CPU.
    }
    event => {
        // Handle a surfaced trap. The trapping instruction is not included
        // in result.instructions and no exception-entry cycles were charged.
        println!("{event:?}");
    }
}
```

An `AddressBus` can return `true` from `take_boundary_request()` when a bus
access discovers host work that must run after the current instruction or
interrupt entry and before another instruction executes. The request is
checked after a normally completed instruction and after an interrupt serviced
on batch entry. Completed cycles are included; interrupt entry does not add to
the retirement count. The request takes precedence over cycle budget
exhaustion. Implementations should consume the request while retaining the
associated work until the host handles the boundary exit.

The 68000 and 68010 may already have instruction words in their hardware
prefetch queue at this boundary. If the host work changes instruction-visible
memory or mapping and those queued words must not be used, call
`cpu.invalidate_prefetch()` before resuming.

Use **`run_for_cycles_with_hook()`** when devices or IRQ lines must be updated
between instructions rather than after an aggregate batch:

```rust
use m68k::CycleBatchControl;

let result = cpu.run_for_cycles_with_hook(&mut bus, 512, |cpu, bus, cycles| {
    bus.advance_devices(cycles);
    cpu.set_irq(bus.interrupt_level());

    if bus.monitor_requested() {
        CycleBatchControl::Return
    } else {
        CycleBatchControl::Continue
    }
});
```

The hook receives the cycles for the just-completed instruction and can inspect
`cpu.ppc` and `cpu.pc`. Its CPU and bus updates are applied before another
instruction is fetched. A hook-requested return uses
`CycleBatchExit::BoundaryRequested`, includes the completed instruction exactly
once, and resumes at the following instruction. Interrupt-entry cycles are
included in `result.cycles` but are not reported as instruction cycles to the
hook. The original `run_for_cycles()` path has no runtime hook check.

Use **`run_for_cycles_with_boundary_hook()`** when the host must also advance
devices for interrupt-entry cycles before the first handler instruction:

```rust
use m68k::{CycleBatchControl, CycleBoundaryEvent};

let result = cpu.run_for_cycles_with_boundary_hook(&mut bus, 512, |cpu, bus, event| {
    let cycles = match event {
        CycleBoundaryEvent::Instruction { cycles }
        | CycleBoundaryEvent::InterruptEntry { cycles } => cycles,
    };
    bus.advance_devices(cycles);
    cpu.set_irq(bus.interrupt_level());
    CycleBatchControl::Continue
});
```

Interrupt entry contributes no retired instruction. Returning from its event
stops before the first handler instruction, and resuming executes that
instruction normally.

Use **`step_with_hle_handler()`** when patching selected guest OS calls while
allowing every unhandled trap to follow hardware behavior. Use
**`run_batch()`** for HLE workloads where host-call latency and instruction
throughput matter more than observing the physical prefetch bus.

## Validation & Testing

This emulator has been rigorously validated against multiple industry-standard test suites to ensure correctness:

### SingleStepTests (m68000)

The [SingleStepTests](https://github.com/SingleStepTests/m68000) project
provides exhaustive per-instruction fixtures from MAME's microcoded 68000 core.
The suite covers every supplied instruction file and 261,894 cases, including:

- All addressing modes and operand sizes
- Edge cases for condition codes (CCR/SR)
- BCD arithmetic (ABCD, SBCD, NBCD)
- Multiply/divide overflow handling
- Exception frame generation
- **Cycle and transaction auditing**: all 261,894 cases match their fixture cycle and bus-access totals, with separate ignored audit tools for access sequence and per-access timing analysis

### Musashi Reference Implementation

We also run binaries from [Musashi](https://github.com/kstenerud/Musashi), a
widely deployed M68000 emulator. The integration tests:

- Execute complete Musashi test binaries
- Verify register state, memory contents, and exception handling
- Cover 68000 through 68040 instruction sets
- Explicitly exclude legacy cases whose undefined BCD flags or illegal
  68000 encodings conflict with the hardware-oriented SingleStepTests model

### Cross-CPU Verification

Additional test suites verify behavior across CPU generations:

- **FPU tests**: 80-bit arithmetic, transcendental functions, packed decimal, memory operands, rounding modes, and save/restore
- **MMU translation tests**: 68030/68040/68060 table walks, ATCs, TTR matching, page crossings, fault frames, and writeback
- **Privilege tests**: User/supervisor mode transitions, TRAP behavior
- **Exception tests**: Per-model frames, resumable bus faults, double faults, and address errors
- **Execution-path differential tests**: Cold/warm cache state, self-modifying code, cycle batches, fast batches, and native traces

### Key Types

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `CpuCore` | Main CPU state and execution APIs |
| `CpuType` | CPU model selection enum |
| `AddressBus` | Extensible memory, device, fetch-cache, timing, and fast-RAM contract |
| `LinearMemoryBus` / `FastMem` | Ready-made flat memory and optional direct-RAM window |
| `HleHandler` | Trap interception callbacks |
| `StepResult` | Single-instruction result |
| `CycleBatchResult` / `CycleBatchExit` / `CycleBatchControl` / `CycleBoundaryEvent` | Precise cycle-scheduled execution result, hook control, and boundary kind |
| `BatchResult` / `BatchExit` | High-throughput instruction-batch result |
| `CpuCore::is_stopped()` | STOP state check |
| `CpuCore::is_halted()` | Double-fault halt check |

## Performance

Accuracy and throughput are separate, deliberate contracts:

- **Precise execution** — `step`, `step_with_hle_handler`, `execute`, and
  `run_for_cycles` use the interpreter and ordinary `AddressBus` calls. These
  paths preserve bus-visible prefetch, access ordering, internal-clock
  synchronization, fault state, and model-specific cycle accounting.
- **Throughput execution** — `run_batch` reuses decoded operations and executes
  eligible hot backward-branch traces through a portable micro-op loop. The
  opt-in `jit` feature compiles those traces with Cranelift on native targets.
  A bus may expose a contiguous `FastMem` window to keep eligible RAM operands
  inside the trace. Guarded exits and self-modifying-code checks fall back
  without partially committing an instruction.

The two paths share instruction semantics and are continuously compared in
cold-cache, warm-cache, memory, control-flow, and fault tests. This keeps the
hardware contract simple for machine emulators while allowing HLE systems to
opt into lower dispatch overhead explicitly.
